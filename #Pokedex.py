#Pokedex
'''Since 1996, the Pok√©mon video game franchise has delighted players around the world with collectible pocket monsters. A Pok√©dex is a device that tracks the information for Pok√©mon that are seen or caught.

Create a new file called pokedex.py.

Next, let's define a Pokemon class with the following attributes:

    entry (integer)
    name (string)
    types (list of strings)
    description (string)
    is_caught (boolean)

Note: Make sure to use the __init__() method.

Next, create an instance method called .speak() that prints a string of the sound a Pok√©mon makes. A Pok√©mon usually just says their name, so make the .speak() simply print out their name twice!

Then, create another instance method called .display_details() that prints the attributes of a Pokemon object like the following:

Entry Number: 25
Name: Pikachu
Type: Electric
Description: It has small electric sacs on both its cheeks. If threatened, it looses electric charges from the sacs.
Pikachu has already been caught!

Lastly, create three Pokemon class objects and use the .speak() or .display_details() instance methods for each one.

For more information about any Pok√©mon you want to add, see the Pok√©dex!

Bonus: For all the super fans, try and add more attributes to the Pokemon class definition, like level, region, height, or weight.'''
